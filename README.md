# Hey there

Here's my Advent of Code 2023 solutions! Fair warning, I am competing with some of my friends to try to get to the solutions fastest (incentivised with an ice cream reward!). As a result, much of this code is going to be hastily written, hacky, and generally unreadable. I've added in editor's notes for clarification in some places/things I learned after the solutions are finished and I've had time to breathe a little and think about more efficient solutions. 

The final solutions will work for part 2, with the original pieces for part 1 commented out where no longer needed.
